# Horse Value
The one animal in FarmingSimulator25 that doesn't really have a purpose is Horses. You can buy them, raise them, and you're forced to ride them every day and the only thing you can do is sell them... for chump change. Well, that's not fun! Let's make horses actually profitable!

**PC only** due to script usage.


## Description from the ModDesc
> It's time to make raising horses worth more! This script mod increases the sell price of horses to be more accurate with the work you put into them, and even makes them a bit cheaper to buy!
>
> Sell Price at 36 months: 15,000 (peak price)\
> Sell Price at 60 months: 10,000

> Big thanks to GMNGjoy, as this is a rebrand of his FS22 mod.
